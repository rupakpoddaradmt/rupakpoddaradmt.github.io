    <h1>Aurex Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Last Updated: 20 November 2023</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect:</h2>

    <p><strong>Minimal User Information:</strong> Aurex requires users to enter a pre-generated Serial Number for login purposes. No other personal information is collected or processed by the app.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Usage:</h2>

    <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Aurex uses the pre-generated Serial Number provided by the user solely for the purpose of user authentication and login. The app does not collect, store, or share any additional user data.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Security:</h2>

    <p><strong>Secure Verification:</strong> Aurex ensures data security by verifying the entered Serial Number with the server during the authentication process. All app functionality is encapsulated within the app itself, and no external data dependencies are required for its core features.</p>

    <h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy:</h2>

    <p><strong>Updates:</strong> We may update our Privacy Policy as needed. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Users are encouraged to check this policy periodically for updates.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us:</h2>
